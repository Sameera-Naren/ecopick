### Project Description
[EcoPick is a Zero-Waste Sustainable Event-Planner website that helps promote sustainability in event planning, by helping people plan eco-friendly celebrations by providing them with greener alternatives, zero-waste checklists and a sustainable vendor directory containing details of eco-friendly caterers, decorators, florists, and rental services etc in their locality.]

### The Problem statement
[We're solving the ridiculous problem of celebrations turning into trash piles‚Äî because memories should last, not the waste! Sustainability in event planning is almost always overlooked. And it is a known fact that Indians love their big fat weddings and grand celebrations, but no one talks about the mountains of waste they leave behind. It's a serious problem hiding in plain sight, and we're here to change that!]

### The Solution
[We provide a go-to guide for exploring eco-friendly decor options, food waste reduction solutions, green catering ideas and sustainable measures to create a zero-waste event space. We also provide a detailed directory containing name, address and contact details of eco friendly vendors, in a specified locality. This will provide the users with easy access to sustainable solutions, at the tip of their fingers! There is also a form where users can share their zero-waste event experiences, hence promoting a sense of community.]

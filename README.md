### Project Description
[EcoPick is a Zero-Waste Sustainable Event-Planner website that helps promote sustainability in event planning, by helping people plan eco-friendly celebrations by providing them with greener alternatives, zero-waste checklists and a sustainable vendor directory containing details of eco-friendly caterers, decorators, florists, and rental services etc in their locality.]

### The Problem statement
[We're solving the ridiculous problem of celebrations turning into trash piles‚Äî because memories should last, not the waste! And it is a known fact that Indians love their big fat weddings and grand celebrations, but no one talks about the mountains of waste they leave behind]
